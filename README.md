# Customer-churn-prediction
* Goal of this project is to implement machine learning model to predict customer churn/customer attrition of a telecom company
* The Dataset has been taken from https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn?select=WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
* As a part of customer retention program, this model can help management to make correct decisions on their future plans

# Technology Stack 
* programming languages & library: python,matplotlib,scikit-learn
* Web-Technologies: HTML,CSS 
* Web-framework:flask
* Miscellaneous :Anaconda,jupyter notebook     

# Steps to run the application
* clone the repository 
* run the ipython notebook,train and download the model 
* Up the backend server by navigating to flask and running app.py python
* The front-end server uses the HTML template and redirects to localhost:5000 where you can predict the churn.
